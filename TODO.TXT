Playback rewind (s=-1)
AddNotes during playback (esp FFWD?) REMOVE <Enter>???
realtime commands argument
   -rt='s=-1,v=10'
stdinNB string-handling -> stdinNB?
extract minutes/seconds from auTx
   -> Wav?


old TODOs, many now TODones:

(OSX)
Make note to use /dev/rdisk# rather than /dev/disk# 
	MUCH FASTER for EXTRACTION (not playback)


https://communities.vmware.com/message/1462318
"I don't know for sure, but I believe the original choice of /dev/disk was
made with some incorrect assumptions - OS X (and BSD in general) shows
/dev/rdisk* as character devices. In the Unix world these are typically not
seekable (for example serial ports), so disk IO is generally limited to
block devices only. However, that's not the case for rdisk devices in OS X
- they can seek just fine, as long as the IOs are sector aligned."

e.g. audioThing -b=0x04 won't work, it's not sector-aligned.
([How] does this work with extraction?)
and searching...?



Don't overwrite files!

PLAYBACK:
sudo nice -n -20 _BUILD/audioThing -b=0x1f1a000 /dev/rdisk2

revisit _wtf/main.c?
